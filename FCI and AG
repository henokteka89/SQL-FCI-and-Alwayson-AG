It says - nodes that are part of the cluster but not the FCI should be excluded from the DNN DNS name.

MSDTC - on the above link it says "On Azure Virtual Machines, MSDTC isn't supported for Windows Server 2016 or earlier with Clustered Shared Volumes"

-- it also says the following NO multisubnetfailover=true means you can't have DNN. 
"Update the connection string of any application connecting to the SQL Server FCI DNN, 
and include MultiSubnetFailover=True in the connection string. If your client does not support the MultiSubnetFailover parameter, it is not compatible with a DNN."
